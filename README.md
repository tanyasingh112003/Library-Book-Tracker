# 📘 Library Book Tracker (Excel Project)

This is a simple **Library Book Tracker** built using **Microsoft Excel**. It is designed to help manage book issues and returns in a small library, classroom, or personal collection. The tracker automatically calculates late return days, fines, and gives a clean dashboard view.
